# MILEAGE PREDICTION USING THREE DIFFERENT MODELS

- ##### I conducted data preprocessing, data visualization, classification tasks and comparison of models to explore and gain a better understanding of different machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- ##### This project served as a practical learning experience in AIML concepts and tools.

## DATASET: 
- ##### MPG Dataset â€“ Kaggle Dataset, originally taken from the StatLib library and Maintained at Carnegie Mellon University.
- ##### The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.
- ##### Data was split into a testing set and training test, where 70 percent of data was put in the training test and the remaining 30 percent was put in the testing set.

## PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF MODELS:
- ##### Initially, the Linear Regression Model was used to make the predictions.
- ##### Later, other models were selected and evaluated - Polynomial Regression and Gradient Regression Models.
- ##### Overall, the best model accuracy observed was in the range of 70% to 77%. 

## MODELS EVALUATED:
- ##### Linear Regression Model: 70% of the variance in the MPG can be explained by the features in the model.
- ##### Polynomial Regression Model: 75% of the variance in the MPG can be explained by the features in the model.
- ##### Gradient Boosting Regression Model: 77% of the variance in the MPG can be explained by the features in the model.
